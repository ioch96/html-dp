# HTML `<cite>` Tag

The `<cite>` tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).

**Note**: A person's name is not the title of a work.

The text in the `<cite>` element usually renders in *italic*.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

  </head>
  <body>
    <p><cite>The Scream</cite> by Edward Munch. Painted in 1893.</p>
  </body>

```
