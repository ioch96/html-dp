# HTML `<h1>...<h6>` Tag

Avoid using multiple `<h1>` elements on one page.

While using multiple `<h1>` elements on one page is allowed by the HTML standard (as long as they are not nested), this is not considered a best practice. A page should generally have a single `<h1>` element that describes the content of the page.

Prefer using only one `<h1>` per page and nest headings without skipping levels.

```html
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is heading 6</h6>
```
