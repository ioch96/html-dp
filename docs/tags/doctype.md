# HTML `<!DOCTYPE>`

All HTML documents must start with a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration.

The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.

In HTML 5, the declaration is simple:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

**Tip**: The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is NOT case sensitive.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!DocType html>
<!Doctype html>
<!doctype html>
```
