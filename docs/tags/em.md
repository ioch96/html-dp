# HTML `<em>` Tag

The `<em>` tag is used to define emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

A screen reader will pronounce the words in `<em>` with an emphasis, using verbal stress.

```html
<p>You <em>have</em> to hurry up!</p>
<p>We <em>cannot</em> live like this.</p>
```
