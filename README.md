# HTML Tutorial

## The most important HTML tags in an overview

HTML tags or commands are used when building a website and they store the most important information for all browsers. In addition to HTML tags for the basic structure, there are also some that you can use to include media, create forms, or set the typeface.

## What are HTML tags?

If you want to learn HTML or write your own HTML code, HTML tags are probably your most important and effective tool. The HTML commands are used to pass information to the different browsers. This way the website is structured in the best possible way and can be displayed by every browser due to the information stored.

HTML tags are represented by a start and an end tag. The HTML commands are placed in angle brackets and contain the desired information, with the end tag being marked by a slash. The combination of start tag, information and end tag is called an element. It is possible to assign an HTML attribute to the element, which contributes further information.

Here you can see an example of the structure of an HTML tag:

```html
<h1>This is a headline</h1>.
```

The HTML tag <h> distinguishes headlines.

There are numerous different HTML tags, and you probably wonâ€™t need them all. In addition, some HTML tags are no longer in use since HTML 5 and later HTML 5.1 were introduced. This is another reason why it is helpful to always have an overview of the most important HTML commands at hand. Below you will find the most common HTML commands in table form, sorted by categories.
